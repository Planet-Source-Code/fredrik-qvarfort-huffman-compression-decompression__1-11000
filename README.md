### Description

This is a Compression/Decompression routine using Huffman Encoding/Decoding, and works best on normal text files.

The code is *highly* optimized, and to show how fast this is I can mention another code sample found here on planetsourcecode (from August 1st 2000) which also uses Huffman Encoding. That code took 127 seconds to compress a 1.8mb textfile, but with my code this takes less than 1 second!! (that's an approvement of 12700%!!). That other code was worth 7 excellent points, how many is this worth? ;)
